# The live client's presented frame rate.
#
# Runs `native/client-probe/fps_probe.bend` under a real X display. The probe is the
# client — its own `start`, `view`, `tick`, window size and tile edge — driven through
# the prelude's own `App.loop` with a fixed frame countdown, and timed. Nothing in
# `native/client.bend` is modified; see the probe's header for why a probe is the right
# place for this.
#
# `App.loop`'s countdown is the frame count: the prelude decrements it once per
# `App.step`, and one `App.step` is one `Window.frame`, which is one `XPutImage`. So
# frames divided by elapsed wall time is the presented rate, measured rather than
# inferred. The runtime's `window_pace` sleeps every one of those frames to the next
# 16.67 ms tick, so 60.00 is the ceiling and anything below it is a frame that overran
# the tick.
#
# This probe deliberately does *not* drive input. A synthetic-key driver was built here
# to count the dig frame live, and it cannot give a trustworthy number: each `xdotool`
# invocation is a Python process sharing the client's four cores, so the driver's own cost
# lands inside the measurement. Sixteen digs at thirty frames read 58.39 FPS with two
# processes per press and 53.16 with one per stream, while the same probe reading no
# input reads 60.00 — so the number moves with the driver, not with the client. And the
# dig frame needs no live confirmation: `frame_edited` measures 16.25 ms against a
# 16.67 ms tick with a *forced* cold rebuild every iteration, and `window_pace` sleeps
# any frame shorter than the tick, so a sub-tick frame presents at the ceiling by
# construction. The harness median plus the quoted pacing code is stronger evidence than
# a live run the driver contaminates.
